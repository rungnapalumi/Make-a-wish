- **Status:** ‚ùå Excluded - Complex variable movement detection required

## üéØ **Detection Priority Order**

The detection algorithm processes motions in this order to avoid conflicts:

1. **Advancing** (body movement)
2. **Retreating** (body movement)
3. **Enclosing** (arm position)
4. **Spreading** (arm position)
5. **Directing** (arm pointing)
6. **Gliding** (smooth movement)
7. **Punching** (forceful movement)
8. **Dabbing** (precise movement)
9. **Slashing** (sweeping movement)
10. **Pressing** (steady pressure)

## ‚úÖ **Verification Complete**

All 10 implemented motion detections now **exactly match** the definitions you provided in `motion_definitions.py`. The algorithm respects the specific characteristics, body part involvement, pathways, timing, and motion clues for each movement type.
